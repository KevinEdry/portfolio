Yes, you read that right. As an engineering manager, it's your duty to strive for this seemingly dubious title. Here's why:

Firstly, let's confront two common traps for new engineering managers. The first is the illusion that success in engineering seamlessly translates to success in management. This is far from the truth. Being a coding prodigy doesn't inherently crown you as a master of management. Why? Because management isn't just another technical problem to solve — it's a human one, where emotional intelligence often trumps your coding IQ.

Then there's the comfort zone issue. Many new managers feel the itch to dive back into coding, aiming to be the mythical 10x engineer — the hero who can code faster than their shadow. But here's the twist: the real heroics in management aren't in out-coding everyone. They're in nurturing your team, in swapping your coding hat for a coach's cap. It's about leading the charge not by doing all the work, but by empowering others to raise their game.

A competent manager can oversee 10 great engineers, focusing on their output and keeping them on track. A stellar manager, however, transcends this. They don't just manage; they mentor. They mold their engineers, helping them level up and become the best versions of themselves. In doing so, they embody the principles outlined in Liz Wiseman's 'Multipliers'. Wiseman's book illuminates how the best leaders are not just geniuses themselves but genius makers. By empowering your team, what happens is quite extraordinary: your inner 10x engineer becomes effectively obsolete. It's about amplifying your impact by enabling the intelligence and capability of your team. In essence, by empowering others, you don't just add value; you multiply it, and as a leader, you 10x yourself by transforming from being the sole star to a catalyst that elevates everyone's capabilities, turning your role from a singular powerhouse to a multiplier of talent and productivity.

# **How to Become the Worst**

Now that we've established the perks of being **the actual worst**, let's delve into the nitty-gritty of achieving this paradoxical goal. It's not as easy as it sounds — there are mainly two paths to embracing your inner 'worst engineer' (I just love this term btw).

As the ringleader of your team's growth, your primary responsibility is to elevate everyone around you. This means analyzing each team member and strategizing how they can outperform you. This is where your managerial prowess shines — not in out-coding them, but in out-growing them.

Secondly, focus on specialization. Encourage your engineers to become masters in specific segments of the development process. By doing so, you effectively become the least knowledgeable person in the room on those specialized topics. Ironically, that's precisely where you want to be.

# **Quantifying the Productivity of an Engineering Manager as the "Worst"**

Measuring your success as the self-proclaimed 'worst' engineer is less about your personal GitHub stats and more about your team's collective wins. It's like being the conductor of an orchestra — you don't play every instrument, but you make sure the symphony sounds fantastic. The real metric of your productivity? How well does your team perform when you're not the one coding. It's about nurturing a team that's resilient, versatile, and can tackle challenges with a sense of independence that would make any parent (or manager) proud.

# **Why You Should Aim to Be the Worst on Your Team, But Not Just Anywhere**

Let's get one thing straight: aiming to be the 'worst' doesn't mean letting your engineering skills gather dust in some forgotten corner of your brain. It's about understanding that your role has evolved. You're no longer the star quarterback; you're the coach. Your job is to empower and inspire, not to hog the limelight with your coding abilities. This strategy doesn't scream "I'm incompetent!" Instead, it whispers, "I'm wise enough to know that my team's growth is my top priority."

# **Conclusion**

So, there you have it. As an engineering manager, your quest to become the 'worst' engineer on the team isn't about diminishing your abilities. It's a strategic shift in perspective, focusing on leadership and fostering a team that's packed with specialized talent. This approach doesn't downplay the importance of technical skills; it redefines their application for the greater good of the team. By embracing this mindset, you're not just managing; you're enabling a powerhouse of collaboration, innovation, and top-notch performance. And let's be honest, isn't that what we all secretly want as managers — to be the brilliant maestro behind a team of rock stars?

So go ahead and be the worst engineer you possibly can, and watch as your team transforms into the best they've ever been.
